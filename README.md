# Self-Driving-Car-Angle-Prediction

This is a project that builds a deep-learning model to map raw pixels from a front-facing camera to steering wheel of a self-driving car. The dataset 1 in [this link](https://github.com/SullyChen/driving-datasets) was used as input data. The result of my model was is sin(angle).

Here are examples of the preprocessed images:
